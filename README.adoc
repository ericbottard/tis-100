# (Yet Another) TIS-100 Emulator

This is a toy project based on the excellent http://www.zachtronics.com/tis-100/[TIS-100] game by http://www.zachtronics.com/[Zachtronics]. If you don't know about TIS-100, but are still reading this, chances are you're a good candidate for buying the game. Do that. You can also buy any other game by Zachtronics with your eyes closed, for that matter. Enjoy then read on...

## Architecture
The project uses an ANTLR generated parser to "compile" a TIS-100 program to a set of instructions.
Communication over ports is abstracted away and the project comes with an implementation on top of 
http://projects.spring.io/spring-integration/[Spring Integration] channels.

Of special interest is the fact that problem specifications are actually lua scripts, so the main runner leverages http://www.luaj.org/luaj.html[luaj] to deal with those.


## Building and running
The project can be built using maven:
```
mvn package
```

The main class is `eric.bottard.tis100.Runner` and allows running a solution against a problem specification, in a terminal, using fancy ANSI art. Both the solution and the specification support the original game format (examples link:src/main/resources/41427.0.txt[here] and link:src/main/resources/spec.lua[here]).

As such, running
```
mvn package exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=eric.bottard.tis100.Runner -Dexec.args="src/main/resources/spec.lua src/main/resources/41427.0.txt"
```

in a big enough terminal window yields this:

(This is my solution to the `SEQUENCE PEAK DETECTOR` original problem).

## Unsupported Features
This is just a proof of concept, and as such some features from the original game
have not been implemented (left as an exercise to the reader, pull requests welcome!):

* There is no support for the `ANY` and `LAST` pseudo-ports
* The Stack node type is not implemented

In addition, you will find that 

* the text UI does not behave exactly as the original (less feedback, _e.g._ ports, input/output advancement)
* there is actually no check that the program conforms to the specification
* nor does the Runner terminate (`CTRL-C` is your friend)
* it does not count cycles, number of instructions or anything

## To be continued
How fast can you say "data driven microservices"?
